# Keys of Kings

This is a collection of mods and library files for KiCad. Just about everything you need is contained in this one library (mechanical keyboard wise) as it makes moving projects from computer to computer far easier. I'd definitely suggest you continue the trend for your projects.

Some of the components in this library have been borrowed from other libraries along with a few of the mod files. Mistakes happen and as such, I do not promise 100% accuracy on these files. It's your responibility to check their datasheets. If you do find a mistake, please let me know.

Happy Clacking ~ King Icewind
